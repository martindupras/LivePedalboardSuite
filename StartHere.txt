StartHere.txt — Quick Start for LivePedalboardSuite Demo
======================================================

1. Prerequisites
----------------
- SuperCollider 3.11 or newer installed and working
- Clone or download the LivePedalboardSuite repository to your computer
- (Optional) Audio interface or headphones for best sound

2. Launch SuperCollider
-----------------------
- Open SuperCollider (scide)
- Open the file: Start_LivePedalboardSystem.scd (usually in the root or a Scripts/ folder)

3. Bring Up the System
----------------------
- Evaluate the following block (select and press Cmd+Return or Ctrl+Return):

(
{
    if(~system.notNil and: { ~system.respondsTo(\shutdownAll) }) { ~system.shutdownAll };
    ~system = LivePedalboardSystem.new(nil);
    ~system.bringUpAll;
    ~system.installAdapterBridge;
}.defer;
)

- Wait for the GUI window to appear and for console logs to confirm bring-up.

4. Run the Demo
---------------
- Open the file: Demo_Today_Playbook_FallbackOnly.scd (or similarly named demo script)
- Evaluate the entire file (select all, Cmd+Return/Ctrl+Return)
- You should see console output like:
    [FALLBACK] entered
    [FALLBACK] apply → /add/delay
    ...
    [FALLBACK] done.
- The GUI window should update with each step.
- You should hear a pleasant melody and effect changes.

5. Troubleshooting
------------------
- **No sound?**
    - Make sure your audio interface is selected in SuperCollider (check ServerOptions)
    - Check your system volume and headphones/speakers
    - Confirm that the Ndef(\testmelody) is playing (see code in ensureGeneratedSources)
    - Try re-evaluating Start_LivePedalboardSystem.scd and then the demo script
- **No GUI window?**
    - Make sure you ran the bring-up block in step 3
    - Check for errors in the SuperCollider console
    - Try closing all SuperCollider windows and re-running from step 3
- **No effect changes?**
    - Confirm the demo script is running (look for [FALLBACK] logs)
    - Check that ~system.pedalboard is not nil (type ~system.pedalboard; in the console)
    - Try restarting SuperCollider and repeating steps 3 and 4
- **Still stuck?**
    - Paste any error messages into an issue on the project repo or ask your team lead

6. Stopping the Demo
--------------------
- To stop all sound, evaluate:
    s.meter; // open meters
    s.quit;  // stop audio server
    // or close SuperCollider

Enjoy exploring LivePedalboardSuite!
