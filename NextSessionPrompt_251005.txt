NEXT SESSION PROMPT
================================================================================

Context:
You are continuing work on the LivePedalboardSuite SuperCollider project.
The previous session focused on creating a robust Make_Project_Inventory.scd script that:
- Scans the suite directory tree (depth 2) and lists all files.
- Collects the first 3 header lines from each .sc and .scd file.
- Displays the adapter file path if present.
- Outputs the inventory into a new IDE Document (no file I/O) with the intended filename on the first line.

Current Achievements:
- Successfully generated an inventory document with the intended filename as the first line.
- Verified that the script adheres to style rules: var-first, descriptive lowercase names, no single-letter locals, no non-local returns, only known-good sclang syntax.
- Avoided all problematic file writes by using Document.new and letting the user save manually.

Current Inventory Snapshot (truncated for brevity in this prompt):
- The suite root is: /Users/martindupras/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheOpenUniversity/LivePedalboardSuite
- Inventory includes directories like CommandTree, LPDisplay, LivePedalboardSystem, MagicPedalboard, utilities, troubleshooting, etc.
- Adapter file: MagicPedalboard/adapter_CommandTree_to_MagicPedalboard.scd exists.

Full inventory content is available in the attached file. Here is the header and first few lines:

Next Steps / Goals for Next Session:
- Add alphabetical sorting for files and folders in the inventory output.
- Add an ignore list for directories and files (e.g., .git, build, cache, large asset folders).
- Optionally add a limit on header lines read per file (e.g., first 8 lines instead of 3).
- Consider adding Markdown or CSV export options for easier sharing.
- Ensure the script remains fully compliant with style rules and uses only known-good sclang syntax.
- Keep the intended filename as the first line for easy copy-paste when saving.

Important Reminders:
- Do NOT reintroduce any file I/O that could fail on OneDrive/iCloud paths.
- Maintain var-first, descriptive lowercase names, no single-letter locals, no non-local returns.
- Use only known-good sclang syntax for functions and method calls.

Deliverable for next session:
- An updated Make_Project_Inventory.scd script implementing the above improvements.
