[GUI]
- Guard against early layout races (flipY(nil)) — fixed today; keep guard after refactors.
- Active chain highlight currently energy-based; switch to canonical CURRENT flag when available.
- Vertical meters between chains OK; consider outer-edge option as a preference toggle later.
- Add font sizing and colour theme presets for iPad mirroring.

[Metering / OSC]
- Maintain /md/levels stability; keep ~md_lastMsgStamp for liveness in System State.
- Keep defensive numeric coercion to avoid type surprises (e.g., false + epsilon).
- Optional Plan‑B after‑group probes: retain code path, add toggle only if required.

[Processors / Choices]
- Wire Processors pane to canonical accessors (CommandTree/queue; chain processor lists).
- Replace temporary ~md_cmdTextProvider hook once accessors are agreed.

[Integration]
- Add Test_MagicDisplayGUI_BootAndScenarios.scd runner (-> a Window).
- Class lift: MagicDisplayProbe + MagicDisplayGUI; integrate into LivePedalboardSystem.bringUpAll.
- Update README with run order + acceptance checks.

[Testing & Demo]
- Create Sim_MIDI_FootAndGuitar_Demo_v0.1.scd: simulate foot controller and guitar flows.
- Add acceptance tests: visual sanity + /md/levels rate checks.

[Tidy / Docs]
- Remove obsolete/borderless/early demo scripts after migration.
- Review documentation for GUI and bring‑up; consolidate examples.

[Performance]
- Verify AppClock update rates (GUI ~30 Hz, text ~5 Hz) on the iPad screen; adjust if needed.

[Future]
- SwitchChain crossfade, ensureServerTree guard in rebuild (carryover items).
- Consider exposing uiGamma and thresholds in a small config panel.
