Forked SH branch to MD_Oct25. The intention is to do my changes from the "stable" known state that we had.

WORKING: 001 Test_LPPedalboard_Minimal -- successfully just runs to LPPedalboard and makes sound. 
    ==== CURRENT ====
    src : testmelodyA
    procs: (none)
    sink: chainA
    eff : chainA -> testmelodyA

    ==== NEXT ====
    src : testmelodyA
    procs: (none)
    sink: chainB
    eff : chainB -> testmelodyA

WORKING: 002  Test_LPOrchestrator_Minimal_NoDisplay.scd -- successfully runs the orchestrator's pedalboard with the display and meter. 

<AskSimon> What is the right solution here? 
When I run the orchestrator with a pedalboard, I get a DNU error because the pedalboard is trying to call a display callback that is not set.
I had to add this line: 
    lpb.setDisplay(nil);             // <<< minimal fix: avoid display callback DNU

Which means I need to fix something. 
  in LPPedalboard 
       setSourcesBoth
    calls 
        showRebuild (I think) 
    which used to be in MagicDisplay but not LPDisplay.

WORKING: 003 Test_ChannelIdentity_AmplitudeProbe.scd

This successfully shows an Ndef that demonstrably passes multi-channel (n-in, n-out).

Full explanation in Test_ChannelIdentity_AmplitudeProbe_README.txt (Verbose and probably not needed but nice if I need to revisit.)
