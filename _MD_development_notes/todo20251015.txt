Right now:

[DONE] add meters to pedlaboardout; check that they display
[NEXT] turn on and off the test signal to source; probably should default to off, but be accessible all the time for testing
[DONE] post to display when rewirechain in NChain (test)
[DONE] post chain list to display when chain changes (if above succeeds)
[DONE - ndefMaker] implement inserting Ndefs created from processor library
[DONE] display chain in top down order (not bottom up as now)
[DONE] do a milestone or tag or whatever. "First system that works" sort of thing.

[IP] collect all possible names from the methods and put in the spreadsheet

- remove the server starts and ensureserver. Probably best done with doing a git "point" so that I try all that and just revert back if it doesn't work. 
- review where I need to do error checking: certainly in the creation of things like ndefs and mutations of the chain and such. 

[NEXT 2] review insert, insertAt, insertTest, insertTestAt -- three should call insert with args

NEXT:
[NEXT 3] change names of panes in LPDisplay
