Right now:

[DONE] add meters to pedlaboardout; check that they display
[NEXT] turn on and off the test signal to source; probably should default to off, but be accessible all the time for testing
- post to display when rewirechain in NChain (test)
- post chain list to display when chain changes (if above succeeds)
- implement inserting Ndefs created from processor library
- collect all possible names from the methods and put in the spreadsheet
