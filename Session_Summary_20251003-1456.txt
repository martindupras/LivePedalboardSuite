SESSION SUMMARY — LivePedalboardSuite × LPDisplay (No-Retap Meters)
Date: 2025-10-03 14:56

1) WHAT WE ACHIEVED TODAY

• Retap-free meters: Implemented inline SendPeakRMS taps inside Ndef(\chainA) and Ndef(\chainB), publishing to /peakrmsA (replyID=1) and /peakrmsB (replyID=2). No external retap scripts required.
• Unified meter address family: LPDisplay meters now subscribe directly to /peakrmsA/B, matching all existing LPDisplay tooling (calibration scripts, layout window).
• Confirmed CM auto-bind path: LivePedalboardSystem_Accessors.sc v0.2.0 returns the real commandManager ivar first, and LPDisplay auto-bind works via LivePedalboardSystem_AutoBindLPDisplay.sc v0.1.0 + LPDisplayAdapter.sc.
• Adapter bridge active: LivePedalboardSystem-AdapterBridge.sc routes canonical short paths (e.g., /add/delay, /switch) to MagicPedalboardNew and toggles ACTIVE chain state for the HUD.
• Clean viewer-only UI: Brought up LPDisplayLayoutWindow as a visualizer (its demo sources silenced via setSourceA(\srcZ) / setSourceB(\srcZ)) so ONLY MagicPedalboard A/B chain ends feed the meters.
• “No bleeps” bring-up: Replaced ensureAudioOn-based demo tone with two clean options: (A) fully silent CURRENT, or (B) calibrated steady tone CURRENT. Both options keep LPDisplay demo muted.
• Root cause for /n_set Node not found identified: switching or control updates occurred when the opposite chain wasn’t playing yet. The fix is to keep BOTH chain ends playing and enforce exclusivity at the source (Option A), so switching is stable and nodes exist.

2) WHAT IS STILL TO DO (PRIORITIZED)

P0 — Make switching & meters bulletproof
  A. One-shot start script (returns -> a Window) that:
     • Opens LPDisplayLayoutWindow (viewer-only);
     • Brings up LPS headless;
     • Enables inline SendPeakRMS taps (/peakrmsA/B);
     • Starts BOTH chain ends playing and enforces exclusivity-at-source;
     • Offers two profiles: Silent CURRENT (default) or Calibrated CURRENT.
  B. Eliminate /n_set errors by ensuring play order: create/arm both ends before any control changes.
  C. Ensure meters remain exclusive to MPB ends (no LPDisplay demo, no external taps).

P1 — Tighten class-level helpers & acceptance
  D. Add LPS helper ensureAudioOnNoTestTone() to replace ensureAudioOn in non-demo runs.
  E. Add a 60-second acceptance block: verifies window, CM auto-bind, adapter bridge, both ends playing, exclusivity, and /peakrmsA/B activity.
  F. Channel consistency: ensure A/B sinks are stereo at bring-up; avoid “wrapped channels from 2 to 1” messages.

P2 — Nice-to-haves
  G. HUD mapping toggle/plumbing (LPDisplayHudMap) in the layout window (enable/disable and presets).
  H. MIDI binding warnings: gracefully handle missing devices to reduce console noise.
  I. Logging polish: optional durable log lines to OneDrive for sessions.

3) COMPREHENSIVE PROMPT FOR NEXT SESSION (PASTE THIS TO COPILOT)

Context
• We’re integrating LivePedalboardSuite with LPDisplay in SuperCollider. I want the meters to be retap-free: SendPeakRMS taps live INSIDE Ndef(\chainA) and Ndef(\chainB), sending to /peakrmsA (id 1) and /peakrmsB (id 2). LPDisplayLayoutWindow is a viewer only; its own demo Ndefs must stay silent.
• Coding rules (strict): var-first; tilde (~) interpreter vars only in scripts; no server.sync; AppClock for GUI; descriptive lowercase names; avoid single-letter locals; methods start lowercase; variable/method names must not start with an underscore.
• Every SuperCollider snippet must start with my header format: three lines then a blank line:
  // <filename-with-extension>
  // vX.Y.Z
  // MD YYYYMMDD-HHMM
  then a short Purpose/Style block before code.
• Non-destructive bring-ups: don’t clear the server tree except on first boot inside class methods. GUI bring-up must return -> a Window.

Today’s target
• Deliver one consolidated start script “Start_LPDisplay_NoRetap_NoBleeps.scd” that:
  1) Opens LPDisplayLayoutWindow as a viewer only (demo sources silenced);
  2) Brings up LivePedalboardSystem headless;
  3) Enables inline SendPeakRMS taps (/peakrmsA, /peakrmsB) inside chain Ndefs;
  4) Ensures BOTH chain ends are playing and enforces exclusivity at source (Option A);
  5) Provides a simple selector for CURRENT source: Silent (default) or a calibrated tone at a chosen peak dBFS;
  6) Returns -> a Window as the last expression.

What you should produce
1) A single .scd script file with my header and comments, ready to paste/evaluate. It must:
   • Use ~ tilde vars only; var-first;
   • Avoid server.sync; use Server.default.bind for server ops; use AppClock for GUI scheduling only;
   • Silence LPDisplay demo sources via setSourceA(\srcZ) and setSourceB(\srcZ);
   • Create/arm Ndef(\chainA).play(2) and Ndef(\chainB).play(2) before any control updates;
   • Call ~system.enableAutoMeters(…) (our patched AutoMeters that sends /peakrmsA/B);
   • Apply Option A exclusivity so inactive chain is silent but alive;
   • Offer a parameter (e.g., ~currentMode = \silent or \cal) and ~peakDb for the calibrated tone;
   • Print a compact acceptance summary (window up, CM up, A/B playing, exclusivity OK).

2) A 60-second acceptance block (separate eval-only snippet) that checks:
   • LPDisplay window exists (-> a Window);
   • CommandManager is bound to LPDisplayAdapter; panes update on updateDisplay;
   • Both chain ends are playing; exclusivity-at-source is active;
   • /peakrmsA and /peakrmsB activity is present (simple OSCdef presence or a brief probe).

3) (Optional) A small class extension file that adds LivePedalboardSystem.ensureAudioOnNoTestTone(), used by the script, keeping server ops clean.

Signals you can rely on
• Accessor fix is in place: LivePedalboardSystem_Accessors.sc returns the real commandManager ivar first, then pedalboard.* fallbacks.
• Auto-bind exists: LivePedalboardSystem_AutoBindLPDisplay.sc + LPDisplayAdapter.sc (display.showExpectation/updateTextField/setOperations).
• Adapter bridge exists: LivePedalboardSystem-AdapterBridge.sc; /switch toggles ACTIVE chain state.
• AutoMeters is patched to SendPeakRMS → /peakrmsA/B with inline Ndef filters; no retap scripts.

What to avoid
• Do NOT send audio from LPDisplay demo sources; they must remain silent.
• Do NOT require any external retap scripts.
• Do NOT clear the server tree except at fresh boot inside class methods.

Deliverables
• 1 x start script (.scd) as described (returns -> a Window).
• 1 x acceptance-snippet (.scd) for quick verification.
• (Optional) 1 x class extension for ensureAudioOnNoTestTone().

If anything is ambiguous, ask one question then proceed with safe defaults.
